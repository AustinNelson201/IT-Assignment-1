<h1>My IT Profile</h1>

<h2>My Personal Info</h2>

<p>Name: Austin Nelson

PICTURE GOES HERE
I was born and raised in the Western suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. I am half Australian and half Dutch with some family still living in the Netherlands however I unfortunately don’t speak any Dutch. I graduated High School from Footscray City College in 2021 which means I had the pleasure of doing year 11 and 12 in lockdown. I have many hobbies including playing basketball and djing. I also have a dog named Maggie who is a cross between a border collie and a blue heeler.

<h2>My Intrests in IT</h2>

<p>I have been interested with technology since I was a child. I’ve always been a big gamer enjoying games from my childhood such as Halo and Rachet and Clank. This eventually turned into a passion to become a game developer however my interest nowadays is more related to cyber security and AI. My mum has also been an inspiration when it comes to my passion with technology as she works in IT for Microsoft and is always talking about how much she enjoys it. I also would love to travel the world and I believe that a career in IT would allow me to be able to work in many different countries around the world. </p>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT originally to study business right after I graduated High School. I choose RMIT because it was a convenient location to where I live, and I had also heard good things from many of my friends that attend the University. After a semester of studying business, I realised that I am much more interested in the technology side of business than the actual business side. So I decided to make the switch and start studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.</p>
<<p>During my study I expect to learn quite a bit. I expect to learn how to learn. This sounds funny but I believe that this is a very important skill especially when working in IT. This is because IT is constantly changing and at all stages of my career, I’m going to have to learn new things all the time. Sure, during my studies learning the basics of current programs and systems will be useful but having the base knowledge of how these systems work and the ability to take this prior knowledge when learning a new program or system will be highly beneficial in my professional career.  </p>

<h2>My Ideal Job</h2>

<p>This is a screenshot of the job listing just incase the link to the post is no longer available.</p>   NEEDS IMAGE OF Job
<p>The position as a cyber security analysist involves all aspects of keeping the company secure digitally. This includes creating and carrying out various tests and assessments in order to gauge if the company has had any breaches and is secure or not, analysing security breaches in order to build up better defences and maintaining and updating cyber security systems. This position is interesting to me because I enjoy the changing landscape of IT and cyber security is one of those areas that are always changing. I feel that this job would be rewarding to me because there is always something new to learn, create or update in order to keep the company secure which keeps things fresh and interesting to me.</p>
<<p>Knowledge and understanding of appropriate regulatory compliances and IT Security frameworks. The examples given on the job advertisement include IS027000, COBIT, NIST 800. The IS027000 is a certification that whereas COBIT which stands for Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies is a framework that needs to be understood. This position also requires a certification in CISSP and/or CISM. CISSP stands for Specific Business Understanding Certified Information Systems Security Professional. To even qualify to take the exam for CISSP I would have had to have had at least 5 years paid experience in the relevant field. This shows that this position is not exactly for graduates and shows that the company is looking for experienced workers</p>
<<p>Currently I would be unable to work at this position as I do not have any of the relevant qualifications and certificates as some of them require a few years’ experience. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Systems so I will have a bachelor’s degree upon completion. Currently however, I have no formal qualifications, experience or certificates in this field. To get the CISSP I will need paid IT experience. I plan to do this through a traineeship program from Microsoft. This will help me get my foot in the door in the world of IT and allow me to build up my skills post University. This traineeship can also help with getting other certificates.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

Personality type: Entrepreneur. ESTP-A </p>\

<<p>These are the results of an online learning style test.</p>
IMAGE OF results
<<p>These are the results from an online Big 5 Personality Test.
  Each section of the Big 5 Personality Test is ranked from 0 to 100
  Openness 65
  Conscientiousness 60
  Extraversion 85
  Agreeableness 62.5
  Neuroticism 27</p>
  <<p>The results of these tests show me that I’m quite extraverted which I would agree with. Unfortunately, I also agree with some parts that I hate to admit such as being unorganised and spontaneous. I found it interesting that the learning style test showed that I am a visual learner and might incorporate this into the way I study.</p>
  <<p>I think these results will positively influence my behaviour in a team as being in a team involves communication and compromises which I am good at. I will be able to allow group member to express their ideas and views and try to incorporate a solution where everyone is happy even though this may come with compromises. Taking some of these results into account I will make sure that I am more organised and stick to a timeframe as I will have other people relying on me. I will create a structure for myself once group responsibilities are set out so that I can easily stick to deadlines and not hold anyone else up in the group because I haven’t completed something.</p>
